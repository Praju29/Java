
# Java Array Shuffling
one.java--
This Java program demonstrates how to shuffle the elements of an integer array using the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm. It randomly rearranges the elements to achieve a randomized order.

# Roman Numeral to Integer Converter in Java
two.java--
This is a simple Java program that converts a Roman numeral in capital letters to an integer. The program takes a Roman numeral as input and returns the equivalent integer value.
# Java Pangram Checker
three.java--
This Java program checks if a given input string is a pangram. A pangram is a sentence that contains every letter of the alphabet at least once.


## Getting Started

To use this program, you should have Java installed on your computer. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Praju29/Java.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Java
```
1. Open the one.java file and make any desired modifications to the array or code.

Compile the Java program:
```bash
javac one.java
```
Run the program:
```bash
java one
```
You will see the shuffled array printed in the console.

2. Open the two.java file and make any desired modifications to the Roman numeral input.
Compile the Java program:

```bash
javac two.java
```
Run the program:
```bash
java two
```
Enter a Roman numeral in capital letters when prompted.
The program will output the equivalent integer value.

3. Open the three.java file and make any desired modifications to the input variable or the code.

Compile and run the Java program:
Compile the Java program:
