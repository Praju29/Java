
# Java Array Shuffling
one.java--
This Java program demonstrates how to shuffle the elements of an integer array using the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm. It randomly rearranges the elements to achieve a randomized order.

# Roman Numeral to Integer Converter in Java
two.java--
This is a simple Java program that converts a Roman numeral in capital letters to an integer. The program takes a Roman numeral as input and returns the equivalent integer value.
# Java Pangram Checker
three.java--
This Java program checks if a given input string is a pangram. A pangram is a sentence that contains every letter of the alphabet at least once.


## Getting Started
